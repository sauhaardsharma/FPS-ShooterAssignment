# FPS JSON Box Shooter

This project is a first-person shooter built in Unreal Engine 5.6 where interactive boxes are dynamically spawned based on online JSON data. Each box has unique attributes such as color, health, and score. The player can shoot and destroy these boxes to earn points.

The primary objective of the project was to gain hands-on experience with Unreal’s HTTP and JSON APIs, dynamic actor spawning, gameplay damage systems, and UI communication between C++ and Blueprints.

## Project Overview

**Genre:** First-Person Shooter

**Theme:** Dynamic Data-Driven Gameplay

**Core Gameplay:**

* Boxes are spawned dynamically from JSON definitions.
* Each box has unique attributes — color, health, and score.
* Boxes can be shot by the player and take damage.
* Destroyed boxes award score to the player.
* Difficulty and variation come from JSON-driven attributes.

## Development Focus

This project was designed as a practical exercise in working with Unreal Engine’s systems and APIs. Key areas of learning included:

* Fetching and parsing JSON using Unreal’s HTTP + JSON APIs
* Error handling for failed HTTP requests and parse issues
* Dynamic spawning of actors and applying attributes from JSON
* Creating and applying dynamic material instances
* Implementing a damage system using line traces
* Communicating between player controller and UI for score updates

## Running the Project

#### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sauhaardsharma/FPS-ShooterAssignment.git
cd FPS-ShooterAssignment
```

#### Open in Unreal Engine

* Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.6.

#### Play the Game

* Run the game in PIE (Play-In-Editor) mode.
* Shoot boxes to test interactions.
* Verify score updates in the UI when boxes are destroyed.

## Technologies

* [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/) - Engine
* [VS ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - IDE
* **C++** - Programming Language
* **Blueprints** - Visual Scripting
* **PC** - Target Platform


## Challenges Faced

#### JSON Fetching

* Faced initial issues with fetching JSON from the URL.

* Resolved compilation errors during HTTP/JSON implementation.

#### UI Updates

* Early attempts failed due to widget updates without proper references.

* Fixed by storing the widget instance in BP_MyPlayerController and routing all updates through it.
